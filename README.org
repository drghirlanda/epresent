/Simple presentation mode for Emacs Org-mode/

* Install

Just install =epresent= from [[http://melpa.org][MELPA repository]].

* Usage

- Call =epresent-run= on an org-buffer.
- press =t= / =1= to view the top level of the presentation
- navigate the presentation with =n/f=, =p/b=
- go to a specific page with =v <num> RET=
- scroll with =k= and =l=
- use =c= and =C= to navigate between code blocks,
  =e= to edit them, =x= to make it run,
  and =s= / =S= to toggle their visibility
- use =i= to split the window and load a file in an additional
  buffer. See example below.
- quit with =q=
 
** Showing another file 

It is sometimes useful to show an additional file. This could be done
with the usual Emacs commands, but sometimes a more "polished" look is
desirable in a presentation. Epresent supports splitting the window to
show a file in a new buffer. This functionality is activated by the
=i= key during the presentation, and it can be tested invoking =M-x
epresent-show-file= outside of the presentation. The filename is set
through the property =EPRESENT_SHOW= and the file is showed by default
to the right of the presentation buffer. It can be shown under the
presentation by setting the property =EPRESENT_BELOW= to a non-nil
value. To hide the file again, delete the window as usual with =C-x
0=.

Here is an example:

#+begin_src org :eval none
    * My slide 
      :PROPERTIES:
      :EPRESENT_SHOW: myfigure.pdf
      :EPRESENT_BELOW: t
      :END:
#+end_src

Any file that can be opened in Emacs can be shown in this way. For
example, a PDF with multiple pages can be used to show more than one
figure in a sequence.
